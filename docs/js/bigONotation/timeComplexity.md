#### O(1) - Constant time

> O(1) describes algorithms that take the same amount of time to compute regardless of the input size.

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic time

> Logarithmic time complexities usually apply to algorithms that divide problems in half every time.

#### O(n) - Linear time

> Linear time complexity O(n) means that as the input grows, the algorithms take proportionally longer to complete.

#### O(n log n) - Linearithmic

> Linearithmic time complexity itâ€™s slightly slower than a linear algorithm.

#### O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Quadratic time

> A function with a quadratic time complexity has a growth rate of n2. If the input is size 2, it will do four operations. If the input is size 8, it will take 64, and so on.

#### O(2<sup>n</sup>) - Exponential time

> Exponential (base 2) running time means that the calculations performed by an algorithm double every time as the input grows.

#### O(n!) - Factorial time

> Factorial is the multiplication of all positive integer numbers less than itself.
