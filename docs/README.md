## Getting started

`cs-notes` is created to help people going through their past knowledge during Computer Science degree, or someone who is interested in learning Data Structures & Algorithms. The topics are written in JavaScript.

The website consists of:

- [Big O Notation](js/bigONotation/timeComplexity)
- [Recursion](js/recursion/recursion)
- [Searching Algorithms](js/searchingAlgorithms/linearSearch/linearSearch)
- [Sorting Algorithms](js/sortingAlgorithms/bubbleSort/bubbleSort)
- [Data Structures](js/dataStructures/singlyLinkedList/singlyLinkedList)
- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](js/dijkstraAlgorithm/dijkstraAlgorithm.md)
